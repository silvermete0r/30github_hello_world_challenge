# 30github_hello_world_challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the 30 GitHub Hello World Challenge! The goal is to write "Hello world!" in 30 different programming languages, with the difficulty increasing gradually by the syntax complexity. This challenge is designed to help you get familiar with various programming languages and their syntax.

## Rules
1. Each "Hello world!" program must be committed as a new file with the corresponding file extension.
2. The file name should follow the format: `hello.<extension>`. For example, `hello.py` for Python.
3. Once you complete a "Hello world!" program, mark it as completed in the table below with a checkmark (✅) and the date of completion.
4. Have fun and enjoy the learning process!
